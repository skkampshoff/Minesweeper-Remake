# Minesweeper Remake

## Overview
This project is a remake of the classic Minesweeper game, built using C# and Windows Forms. The game features a grid of squares, some of which contain hidden mines. The player reveals squares and aims to avoid the mines while using logic to flag potential mine locations.

## Features
- **Grid-based gameplay**: Randomized mine placement and a fully interactive grid.
- **Adjustable difficulty**: Players can select different grid sizes and the number of mines.
- **Timer**: A live game timer tracks the duration of the game.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of top scores from play session.
- **Polymorphism and OOP principles**: Encapsulates game logic within classes for grids, squares, and player actions.

## Technologies
- **C#**: Core game logic and object-oriented design.
- **Windows Forms**: GUI components like buttons, sliders, and labels.
- **Randomization**: Used for placing mines randomly on the grid.
- **Event handling**: For managing user interactions, such as clicks and flagging squares.

## What I Learned
- Object-oriented programming principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- Building user interfaces using Windows Forms.
- Handling events and implementing game logic efficiently.
- Working with version control using Git and GitHub.
